# evil-commentary

[evil-commentary] is intended to be a port of [vim-commentary].

> Use <kbd>gcc</kbd> to comment out a line (takes a count),
> <kbd>gc</kbd> to comment out the target of a motion (for example,
> <kbd>gcap</kbd> to comment out a paragraph), <kbd>gc</kbd> in visual
> mode to comment out the selection.

I wrote this because of that I really admire the work of [tpope] the
author of [vim-commentary] and want to have something really simple
(less than 100 lines) like he did with his [vim-commentary].

## Feature complete

[evil-commentary] is considered feature complete as of `v2.0.0`. The
integration part maybe added in the future though.

## Install

The easiest way to install `evil-commentary` is by `package.el` through
melpa [melpa](https://melpa.org/#/getting-started) then try it
with

```lisp
M-x evil-commentary-mode
```

To enable `evil-commentary` permanently, add

```lisp
(evil-commentary-mode)
```

to your `init.el`.

Or manually clone [evil-commentary] to your `loadpath` and add those
line to `init.el`

```lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/evil-commentary")
(require 'evil-commentary)
(evil-commentary-mode)
```

## Default mappings and commands

The default mappings will enable the `operator` `evil-commentary` to
<kbd>gc</kbd>. That means we will be free to use it with any available
`motions` and `arguments`. <kbd>gcc</kbd> does also work as
expected. Try <kbd>gcap</kbd> to comment out a paragraph or to
uncomment a paragraph that is already commented out.

`:g/TODO/evil-commentary` can be used to toggle comments on all lines
that contain the string "TODO".

I also bind <kbd>super</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd> as a stand-alone *de facto*
default key binding in most text editors. It's should work in `emacs`
and `insert` states too. (Evil is however still required.)

### Copy and comment

When working with code, it is often useful to try different
variations or different settings. `evil-commentary-yank` does the
same, but also copies the original code so it can be pasted (<kbd>P</kbd>)
and modified accordingly.

| Map | Command                   |
|-----|---------------------------|
| gc  | evil-commentary           |
| s-/ | evil-commentary-line      |
| gy  | evil-commentary-yank      |
|     | evil-commentary-yank-line |


## Comment function

By default, `evil-commentary` use `comment-or-uncomment` function. By
specify an alist of modes
`evil-commentary-comment-function-for-mode-alist`, the comment
function provided by major mode will be use instead.

A comment functions has to accept BEG, END as its required parameter.

[this commit](https://github.com/linktohack/evil-commentary/blob/9f5bc144c591f0bec7da8dd325fa24235f0412df/ec-mode-comment-functions.el)
if a customized one is needed.

## Custom mappings

You're free to map `evil-commentary` and `evil-commentary-line` to
anything you want. If you find that <kbd>,cc</kbd> is more
elegant/convenient, consider having a look on [evil-space] to keep
`evil-repeat-find-char` functional...

To customize keys, consider add something like this into `init.el`.

```lisp
(define-key evil-motion-state-map "," nil)
(evil-define-key 'normal evil-commentary-mode-map ",c" 'evil-commentary)
(define-key evil-commentary-mode-map (kbd "M-;") 'evil-commentary-line)
```
